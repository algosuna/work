                          <p style="text-align:justify">We are living in a new era. With new technologies and applications, our method of relating to one another has changed and continuously develops.  Human Beings desire truth, love, relationships and justice.  Christians know these longings and find themselves called by God to help quench the thirst of those seeking by bringing the grace of God to every Human Being. Yet today, we are failing to effectively do so. Ministries were once pioneers in communication. The Apostle Paul, Martin Luther, Aimee McPherson and Billy Graham traveled the globe, preaching and converting thousands upon thousands to a radical message inspired by the Holy Spirit. Those converted founded hospitals, universities, churches and businesses. Clearly, Christians had mastered the <p style="text-align:justify">Art of Communication in sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p> Today however, Christians have fallen short of that reputation, lagging behind in adopting new forms of communication. Namely, Christians are lacking in their efforts to utilize new media. It is only recently that Christian organizations have been bold enough to announce meetings and classes to discuss new media and their implications to Christian Ministries and Christian Businesses. Meanwhile, new media continues to develop even more.  Technology continues to advance, leaving ministries behind.</p>

                          <p style="text-align:justify">The Apostle Paul instructed the Corinthians to "run as to win" the race (1 Corinthians 9:24) If Christians are not doing this in terms of utilizing new media, action must be taken! The purpose of "Going Digital for His Kingdom" is build a foundation for Christian Ministries, Christian Businesses, and Christians who want to make a difference, in the effective utilization of new media. We believe that there are unique benefits in utilizing new media that bring faith to the seeking. New Media benefits the local church, evangelism, community building and other communication efforts to the faithful in our church, in our community and around the world!</p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify">Going Digital for His Kingdom Events explores with our attendees, the criticisms and critiques of new media from inside and outside the Christian Sector. We explore the concept that online communication is shallow and isolating. We will help to ease the minds and hearts of many who are fearful of the idea that Christians will become advocates of new media. These events acknowledge that with the use of new media, new benefits appear.</p>
                          <p style="text-align:justify">While Christian Organizations have slowly engaged small group settings as a part of a larger conference or meeting to discuss new media, Going Digital for His Kingdom is completely devoted to exploring the relationship between Christians and new media and inspiring, motivating and training Christian Leaders to effectively use new media and answer the needs of a world that is placing increasing importance on new and social media.</p>

                  <p>Going Digital for His Kingdom Events explores with our attendees, the criticisms and critiques of new media from inside and outside the Christian Sector. We explore the concept that online communication is shallow and isolating. We will help to ease the minds and hearts of many who are fearful of the idea that Christians will become advocates of new media. These events acknowledge that with the use of new media, new benefits appear.</p>
                  <p>While Christian Organizations have slowly engaged small group settings as a part of a larger conference or meeting to discuss new media, Going Digital for His Kingdom is completely devoted to exploring the relationship between Christians and new media and inspiring, motivating and training Christian Leaders to effectively use new media and answer the needs of a world that is placing increasing importance on new and social media.</p>

Before answering the call of God, she was a successful interior designer in Dallas.  But when the revelation of the word of faith came, it changed her life forever - setting her free and free indeed!  The Lord divinely brought Mylon and Christi together, and she was set apart and ordained by Kenneth and Gloria Copeland on their wedding day.  Christi's passion is two-fold.  First, to see others set free through the revelation knowledge of the truth of God's Word.  Secondly, that women in the Body of Christ would rise up and walk in the fullness of their calling in these last days!</p>

                                               <p>Two years after graduating from Samford University, Billingsley joined Christian music group NewSong as their lead vocalist. In 1996 he moved on to begin his solo career and traveled the country, performing an average of 200 concerts a year. In 2000 and 2001 he and Shae were blessed with the births of their sons Caleb and Cooper, and when the boys were just babies the family decided to take a step of faith and move to Lynchburg, Virginia where Billingsley became worship pastor at Thomas Road Church and artist-in-residence at Liberty University.</p>
                                               <p>In 2005 the family moved across the country to serve alongside Dr. David Jeremiah at Shadow Mountain Community Church and Turning Point Ministries in San Diego, California. Two years later the Billingsley's felt God's call to return to Lynchburg where the family has been residing ever since. In addition to his roles as worship leader at Thomas Road and his involvement in the worship department at Liberty University, Billingsley has also taken on Red Tie Music, a music publishing company, and several small businesses on the side. Billingsley still makes time to minister to an average of 100,000 people each year by leading worship at conferences all over the country.

                                               <p>Angela Primm is one of the premier voices of our time. Her musical history spans genres, continents, and audiences. She has commanded the attention of mega-stars from Aretha Franklin, Barbara Mandrel, and Brooks and Dunn to Southern Gospel music legends, Dolly Parton, and the late Vestal Goodman. Angela's background is what dreams are made of, and she is only beginning to step into the fullness of her purpose.</p>

                                            <p>Singing behind musical geniuses, Andre Crouch, Patti Austin, Bill Gaither, Gretchen Wilson and others, her four-octave soprano voice added rich tones and depth of sound to each artist's recording.  Angela Primm whose gift of song, love of the Gospel and Gospel music has catapulted her, as the Bible says, "before great men."  Her current and inevitable step as solo artist is the natural progression of a life divinely designed.</p>
                                            <p>Angie is also a wife and business woman. True to her down-to-earth personality, she considers her most important achievement to be marrying her soul mate, John Primm. A successful business man as well as fine vocalist himself, he is Angie's biggest fan, chauffeuring her and caring for her on many of her personal appearances. He knew how to love her 20 years ago and continues to do so to this day. Together, they established "Still Waters, Christian Light Club, Inc.," a live Christian cabaret that never compromises the Gospel. The fresh and exciting show is a huge hit in Nashville!</p>

                                            <p>Angela was raised in the church by her precious mother, who was also a singer. Angie's mom would sing the foot-stompin' and  joyful, "Couldn't Keep It To Myself!" with such fervor, she would often lose her wig; but she would swoop it up and place it back on her head – backwards, and not miss one beat of her favorite song!  Church members would laugh and shout right along with her! (Telling this particular memory of her mother makes Angie rear back in laughter herself!) </p>

                                            <p>"Couldn't Keep It To Myself!" is also a favorite song of Gospel legend, Bill Gaither and is featured on Angela Primm's sophomore project, Sanctuary.  This CD along with her debut CD, A Little Bit of Heaven have been selling out wherever Angie performs – from concerts to cruises. Bill and Gloria Gaither have embraced her as a daughter and always make room for her to sing in their sold-out concerts and Gaither videos. </p>

                                            <p>Angie's beautifully wide smile lights up a room and her fun-filled disposition carry an exuberance that is electric and contagious! Moreover, her anointed and powerful voice makes the cares of this world melt into puddles at your feet.  Angela Primm is "a little bit of heaven" to those blessed to know her, or experience her music, her joy, and her wonderful laugh!  </p>

                                            <p>What lies ahead for Angela Primm? Her future rests securely in God's hands. But one thing we know for sure is that wherever Angie goes, and whatever Angie does, she will be giving her heart and soul to the people God loves, for the love of her Lord. That's the way it was, the way it is, and the way it always will be. </p>

                                               <p>There's nothing small about the woman who was first introduced to the world as "Little Helen." Big voice. Big heart. Big vision. These are but some words that conjure up the essence of Dr. Helen Baylor. The four-time GRAMMY® nominated, four-time Stellar Award winning, two-time Dove Award winning, and Soul Train Lady of  Soul Award winning artist is undoubtedly one of the biggest voices in Gospel music. Singer, songwriter, author, actress, minister, philanthropist and honorary doctor, Helen's deep well of life experience has been poured into a body of work that indeed makes a legacy.</p>

                                    <p>But where did the legacy begin? It was at the tender age of thirteen that Little Helen took the R&amp;B world by 
                                    storm with her ever-popular singles, "The Richest Girl in the World" and "What About Me, Boy?" However, 
                                    Helen wasn't just one of the many doo-whop wonders of the 60's. Despite her young age, she could phrase a 
                                    song with such maturity. She sang like a woman twice her age and she stood out. By her early teens, she was 
                                    the opening act for big-name artists such as Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and B.B. King. At 17, she took off 
                                    for adventure with the touring company of the rock musical "Hair." </p>

                                    <p>This would mark the beginning of a life played out on the international stage as Helen's powerful voice carried 
                                    her around the world, singing back up for Captain & Tennille and Rufus and Chaka Khan. She later recorded 
                                    with the Los Angeles based group, Side Effect, and received critical acclaim for her lead vocals on "Always 
                                    There" and "S.O.S." </p>

                                    <p>Singing engagements, studio sessions, travel, industry parties— Helen's was a glamorous life. Yet, for all of the
                                    success and glamour, she found herself descending into a dark tunnel of drug addiction and relationship abuse.
                                    Following a ten-year battle with substance abuse, Helen found the Lord and a church home. Still, she didn't 
                                    sing or perform for four years until God released her from her "backside of the desert experience." Of this 
                                    time, Helen proclaims, "I had a prayin' grandmother." From much prayer, she emerged from the dark tunnel 
                                    dedicated to glorifying God through Gospel music. </p>

                                    <p>In 1989, Helen recorded her first Gospel album the legendary, Highly Recommended, which stayed in print for 
                                    20 years and produced the chart-topping songs "Can You Reach My Friend," "No Greater Love," and "Highly 
                                    Recommended." This was followed by the critically acclaimed Look A Little Closer with the singles "Look a Little 
                                    Closer," "Victory," and "Oasis," a song that spent a year on the UK dance charts. Next, was the chart-topping
                                    The Live Experience, which became her most successful album. Recorded in 1994 before more than 7,000 fans 
                                    at Crenshaw Christian Center, in Los Angeles, CA, The Live Experience remained on the Billboard Charts for 
                                    over a year, with 27 weeks at #1. A DVD of the concert was also produced. Yet, it is the riveting and candid life 
                                    story in "Helen's Testimony," that has made Helen Baylor a name in the Gospel music world. Known as 
                                    "Praying Grandmother," the song has become an anthem for hurting people everywhere.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to her stellar hits, Helen's prolific legacy includes six more albums on Word, Verity, Sony and MCG 
                                    records and collaborations with such industry greats as Andre Crouch, Aaron Neville, Donnie McClurkin, 
                                    Marvin Winans, Deniece Williams, Gerald Albright, Joe Sample, Bill Maxwell, Paul Jackson Jr., Bob Carlisle, the 
                                    late Billy Preston, Phil Driscoll, Abraham Laboriel, Tony Maiden, and Justo Almario, to name a few.</p>

                                    <p>A much sought-after artist, Helen has been a featured soloist on Bishop T.D. Jakes' God's Leading Ladies
                                    compilation CD, five of the legendary WOW Gospel CD's, including The Real Meaning of Christmas, and Gotta 
                                    Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan with her single "What Can I Do For You?" Making her mark in 
                                    film and TV, Helen's single "Midnight Cry" was featured on the Left Behind movie soundtrack and she appeared on the Martin Lawrence TV show, including the final episode, where she performed the classic 
                                    Donny Hathaway song, "Someday We'll All Be Free."</p>

                                    <p>While her musical gifts have the ability to touch hearts, Helen's spiritual gifts have the ability to transform 
                                    souls. The calling on her life was first recognized in 1995 by her then-pastor, Dr. Frederick K.C. Price, under 
                                    whom she became an ordained minister. Moved by her ministry, the late Dr. Edward Michaelson of Friends
                                    International Christian University, surprised Helen by flying to Washington, D.C. and conferring upon her an 
                                    Honorary Doctorate in Sacred Music. Since then, Helen has operated in the calling of an evangelist—a musical 
                                    evangelist, whose gifting stir up the body of Christ to evangelize to others around the world.</p>

                                    <p>With so many life experiences, Helen's legacy continues… not only in concert halls and churches, but also in 
                                    prisons, women's shelters and housing projects, where she's spreading the message of God's saving power 
                                    through music. "My heart goes out to everyday people, folks on the street, folks from my hood-to your hood. If I 
                                    can make the Gospel message plain to just one person and they receive the love of Christ, then I've fulfilled my 
                                    purpose." – Helen Baylor</p>

                                    <p>Today, after a five-year hiatus, Helen is returning from a much-needed sabbatical, refreshed and energized.
                                    She is excited about the launch of her new CD, The Legacy Years: Celebrate the Experience. In the works are a 
                                    new album, the launch of her nonprofit, Phoebe's Heart Foundation, and a Legacy Years tour. </p>

                                               <p>His mother played piano at church, and dad was a singer. The family's life was centered around the church and their faith. When Marshall reached high school in 1985, he joined the church youth group and attended the state youth convention. At the age of 14, he made a decision to follow Christ.</p>
                                              <p>After high school, Marshall followed in his father's footsteps and attended Anderson University in Anderson, IN. While singing at his church in Anderson, Marshall was approached by a local producer and asked to sing for a project at Gaither Studios. He never really expected to actually end up singing for a living, but about a year after graduating from college, he quit his job at a furniture store and began working as a studio singer full time.</p>
                                              <p>During one session for Bill Gaither, Marshall was asked to join the Homecoming artists in Memphis, TN for a video - taping session. Subsequent videos followed for Marshall, including tapings in Indianapolis and New York City at Carnegie Hall.</p>
                                              <p>He also found a spot as a back-up singer on projects for recording artists John Tesh, Clay Walker and Carman, among others. He has written songs for several Gaither Videos, as well as for Salvador, Point of Grace, fellow Gaither Vocal Band member David Phelps and the Vocal Band.</p>
                                              <p>In December, 2002, Marshall's music lead him to another frontier - marriage to Sweetwater, AL native Lori Vick in April 2003. The couple have two daughters, Presley (born in 2006) and Allison Reese (born in 2008).</p>
                                              <p>In 2003, he released a solo studio album, Wisdom of Fools which included 2 songs which were used by Point of Grace in their album I Choose You and Boundless in 2005 which included the old song from his former group.</p>
                                              <p>In January, 2004, the newly-weds life would change again when Marshall received a call from Bill Gaither asking him to call Guy Penrod. From this phone call, Marshall began a one and a half month audition process to become the new baritone for the Gaither Vocal Band. He was a part of three of the Vocal Band's studio albums including Give It Away, Lovin' Life and Christmas Gaither Vocal Band Style. Marshall has been on the road with the Gaither Vocal Band from then on.

                                                                               <p>

When Mylon was 17 years old, his first song, "Without Him," was recorded by Elvis Presley.  Over the next year 126 artists recorded Mylon's songs.  At 19 he made his first album and has sold millions since then.</p>

                                              <p>Since accepting Jesus as the Lord of his life in 1980, Mylon has released 12 CDs, traveled over a million miles, been honored with a Grammy Award and two Dove Awards, and sold another million records.  In 2004 Mylon was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Life Christian University, in 2005 he was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame, and in 2007 he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.  His latest CDs focus more on worship and praise.</p>

                                              <p>In the last few years God has called for tremendous change in Mylon's life and ministry.  Mylon explains, "Up until a few years ago I was a Christian musician who preached a little, worshipped a little, and rocked a lot.  I'm thankful for the anointing of God upon our lives during that season, and I know that we have been and are led by His Spirit.  But I have become a preacher/teacher and worshiping God has become my lifestyle."</p>

                                              <p>"Over these last 30 years, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people make a decision to make Jesus Christ Lord of their lives, praise God.  We've seen the goodness of God at every turn, and this new season of ministry has become even more glorious than anything we've experienced in the past."</p>

                                              <p>Mylon's desire to minister to the church and evangelize the world is more powerful than ever.  "More than ever before we need to proclaim the Word of God and to emphasize to every nation His promise to perform it for whoever believes it."</p>

                                              <p>"I will always write songs to and about my Lord.  The splendor of His holiness constantly amazes me.  I believe the music that God gives me is anointed and has an important place in my ministry.  But I am compelled to share His Word.  It is the best news on this planet!  I believe that if we do things His way, with His attitude, He will take us from glory to glory and teach us how to 'dwell in the secret place of the most High God' (Psalm 91) where victory in Jesus is guaranteed!"</p>

                                              <p>"In the last few years we have ministered to millions on Christian TV, and in hundreds of churches, revivals, and crusades.  God has allowed us the privilege and honor of teaching His Word at Bible Schools, worship seminars, motorcycle rallies, NASCAR owner/driver chapel services, NFL and NBA chapel services, and Christi's ladies meetings.  We have also had missionary opportunities in the former Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, the Philippines, Cayman Islands, Mexico, and Hawaii.  We also have a commitment to Mike Barber Ministries to minister with him in the prisons of our nation where we are seeing revival explode."</p>

                                              <p>With overcoming faith and an increasing understanding of God's Word and its promises, Mylon is looking forward to the future.  Jer. 29:11 says, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, said the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end."  We believe our future is very bright and full of promise."

What a paradox! We've witnessed the appearance of great revolutions: Facebook, Twitter, Kickstarter or Wordpress; platforms which have dismantled the status quo we lived in. However, we've also witnessed the disappearance of many other platforms that didn't quite manage to find their space in the online world (or generate a stable business model): Foursquare, Google Buzz, Ping, etc</p>
                                  <p>"The Internet of Things" has to give way to "The Internet of People" or, in other words, Human Media; a more human, resonating and efficient way of understanding the social web. In this workshop we will work on the strategic principles for a more human online communication and marketing and also the tactics for staying human through the social web and connecting in a more resonating way. How to add on organizations and brand the human touch that changes everything. No person or organization should forget them if they want to earn their space in this digital economy.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Jesus promised He would always be with us (Hebrews 13:5); that His presence would be with us when we gather in His name (Matthew 18:20); and here we are promised that we enter the presence of God, in a very special way, when we are worshiping and praising Him. You can sense the presence of God in a very powerful way as you are worshiping. We enter the court room of Heaven (the presence of God) through praise and worship.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Everything we do in life and everything we neglect to do is how we communicate with God. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) "…Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age….."  calls us to evangelize.  It calls us to utilize any and every method available in today's world. </p>

                             <img src="img/bios/gina-storr.jpg" width="175" align="left"> <h4>(Moderator: Gina Storr)</h4>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">The truth of the matter is that Social Media is here to stay and whether we like it or not, people who attend worship and other church events will share content about the event before, during and after,  across the internet.   What if church leaders could influence what, when and how it is shared so that the message matches the core values and identity of the church and helps generate excitement while increasing attendance?  </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">This workshop will increase your understanding of the methodology in using full sensory immersive audio, video and lighting.   You will gain insight into how people receive and experience worship today. Effective use of this "next generation technology" will help you deliver the Word of God in way that is both dynamic and life changing.  We will empower you as leaders to begin your journey by understanding the impact of well-developed worship technology and how it will help your ministry not only survive, but grow and expand.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Charles Billingsley is no stranger to the Christian music industry. His accomplished career has included a two-year tenure as lead vocalist for award-winning vocal group Newsong, and a lengthy list of solo performances across the nation and beyond. With many full-length recordings, Charles has continued to build a loyal following over the years, and is recognized as one of Christian music's most powerful inspirational vocalists. "I think we all have one common goal in ministry—to see lives changed. These are songs that will help us do that, but it's important for us to remember that worship is not just about music. It's a lifestyle. I hope these songs will spur believers onward to live that lifestyle of worship" Charles said.

Mark hopes that his Portrayals will encourage people to get to know those who were closest to Jesus, to dig deeper into the Scriptures and to grow in their faith.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">This workshop will increase your understanding of the methodology in using full sensory immersive audio, video and lighting.   You will gain insight into how people receive and experience worship today. Effective use of this “next generation technology” will help you deliver the Word of God in way that is both dynamic and life changing.  We will empower you as leaders to begin your journey by understanding the impact of well-developed worship technology and how it will help your ministry not only survive, but grow and expand.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Good intentions are never enough.  Intentions must be combined with strategic plans and actions.  And to be effective in today’s fast-changing culture, a whole new approach for successful missional presence must be constantly considered and reconsidered.  What are the new tools available?  What is the culture drawn to these days and how can the church respond?  How can you be faithful to Kingdom values and still contextualize your approach? How can you identify your strongest, most effective presence in the world that sets you apart from all other organizations and ministries—the presence that’s uniquely you?</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Do you ever wonder how to fill your pews, keep them coming and how to get people excited about getting involved in church? This presentation will explore the use of social media in bringing people to an awareness of the life, worship and events of your particular congregation. It will also explore the use of “Online Bible Studies” and the effectiveness of other faith-building resources using the Internet.</p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify">Developing a stance on effective use of digital tools in discipleship and staying informed and educated on the strategies of utilization…that fits YOUR ministry! It is not a “one size fits all” kind of approach. All information gathered must be applied to the individual ministry and a unique strategic plan should be built.
                                <ul><li>How might technology, like Instagram, be a creative platform to invigorate or reinvigorate your ministry?</li>
                                <li>What resources exist in your institution and beyond to help you utilize technology in new ways?</li>
                                <li>In your own work and life, how is social media redefining community and connection? How are you responding to these changes?</li></p>

                                <p>When Paul gave Timothy special instructions about Public meetings, he said, "Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching" (1 Timothy 4:13). Part of the emphasis in public worship includes these three things: hearing the Word, being called to obedience and action through exhortation, and teaching. It is only in the context of local assembly that these things can most effectively take place.</p>
                                
                              <p>The active involvement of local churches is imperative to living a life without compromise and growing God's Kingdom. It is through the local church that ministries, business leaders and believers can receive the kind of teaching, accountability, and encouragement that is necessary for them to stand firm in their convictions. God has ordained that the church provide the kind of environment where an uncompromising life can thrive and His people can grow inspirationally, intellectually and spiritually.
                              The church is the local representation of a worldwide Body of Christ! When the local church is the gathering place, it becomes the focal point for mutual edification and the praise. </p>

                              <p>Going Digital for His Kingdom Events are held in churches around the United States. In partnering with local churches, we are able to contribute to the growth of the local church through education, finance and community involvement. Local churches host workshops, concerts, presentations and conferences. Our primary attendees come from 150 mile radius of the local church. </p>

                              <p>Our host churches are filled with people who love God and want to see God's Kingdom grow. They help and support our mission by welcoming our staff, speakers and artists. They welcome our attendees, regardless of race, religion or doctrinal differences, or anything else that might make us seem different. We want to work with churches that accept and embrace everyone for who they are, just like Jesus does. Our host churches have the following qualities:</p>

                              <ul>
                              <li>A church with a heart to host an area-wide, Kingdom Growing event for all denominations, cultures and ethnic backgrounds.</li>
                              <li>A church with a senior pastor who supports hosting an area-wide event.</li>
                              <li>A church with a strong ministry leadership team.</li>
                              <li>A church willing to establish a Local Organizing Team made up of qualified "team leaders" from area churches.</li>
                              <li>A church committed to mobilizing at least 10 area churches to work together to promote the event in the area.</li>
                              <li>A church with a venue large enough to seat a minimum of 1800 concert attendees and 100 workshop attendees.</li>
                              <li>A church able to provide on-site security, traffic control and access into and exiting the venue.</li>
                              <li>A church able to provide professional-level audio, video and sound capabilities for the event.</li>
                              <li>A church that has a passion to unite their region for Christ and Grow the Kingdom.</li>

                  <!-- <h3 class="title">Social Media and Technology Conference</h3>-->
                  <p style="text-align:justify">We are living in a new era. With new technologies and applications, our method of relating to one another has changed and continuously develops.  Human Beings desire truth, love, relationships and justice.  Christians know these longings and find themselves called by God to help quench the thirst of those seeking by bringing the grace of God to every Human Being. Yet today, we are failing to effectively do so. Ministries were once pioneers in communication. The Apostle Paul, Martin Luther, Aimee McPherson and Billy Graham traveled the globe, preaching and converting thousands upon thousands to a radical message inspired by the Holy Spirit. Those converted founded hospitals, universities, churches and businesses. Clearly, Christians had mastered the  <p style="text-align:justify">Art of Communication in sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p> Today however, Christians have fallen short of that reputation, lagging behind in adopting new forms of communication. Namely, Christians are lacking in their efforts to utilize new media. It is only recently that Christian organizations have been bold enough to announce meetings and classes to discuss new media and their implications to Christian Ministries and Christian Businesses. Meanwhile, new media continues to develop even more.  Technology continues to advance, leaving ministries behind.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify">Would God want us to be left behind?</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify">The Apostle Paul instructed the Corinthians to "run as to win" the race (1 Corinthians 9:24) If Christians are not doing this in terms of utilizing new media, action must be taken! The purpose of "Going Digital for His Kingdom" is build a foundation for Christian Ministries, Christian Businesses, and Christians who want to make a difference, in the effective utilization of new media. We believe that there are unique benefits in utilizing new media that bring faith to the seeking. New Media benefits the local church, evangelism, community building and other communication efforts to the faithful in our church, in our community and around the world!</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify">Going Digital for His Kingdom Events explores with our attendees, the criticisms and critiques of new media from inside and outside the Christian Sector. We explore the concept that online communication is shallow and isolating. We will help to ease the minds and hearts of many who are fearful of the idea that Christians will become advocates of new media. These events acknowledge that with the use of new media, new benefits appear.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify">While Christian Organizations have slowly engaged small group settings as a part of a larger conference or meeting to discuss new media, Going Digital for His Kingdom is completely devoted to exploring the relationship between Christians and new media and inspiring, motivating and training Christian Leaders to effectively use new media and answer the needs of a world that is placing increasing importance on new and social media.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify">Please review the many events and opportunities to grow God's Kingdom listed in this website.</p>
